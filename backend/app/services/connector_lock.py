"""PgBouncer-compatible connector sync locking via lease rows.

Replaces the previous session advisory lock which required a dedicated
PostgreSQL connection for the entire sync duration and was incompatible
with transaction pooling. The new implementation uses short-lived
database transactions to acquire, renew, and release a lease row.
