# Nexora

Nexora is a document-grounded AI workspace for teams. It turns approved documents and connected sources into knowledge collections that people can search, discuss, and verify through cited answers.

The project follows a clear path from knowledge to answer:

```text
Create a knowledge set → add documents or sources → process and index content → ask a question → inspect sources and answer confidence
```

## What Nexora includes

- **Grounded conversations** — retrieve relevant document chunks and present answer sources alongside a confidence state.
- **Knowledge sets** — organize documents into focused collections with per-user access levels.
- **Document ingestion** — upload PDF, TXT, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF files; track queue, extraction, OCR, chunking, and indexing progress.
- **Optional OCR** — extract content from scanned documents with MinerU, Google Vision, or Azure Document Intelligence.
- **Assistants** — connect assistant behavior to one or more permitted knowledge sets.
- **Controlled sharing and feedback** — publish revocable read-only conversation snapshots and collect answer feedback.
- **Connectors** — synchronize supported website, GitHub, Google Drive, S3, SharePoint, and webhook sources through a background scheduler.
- **Team boundaries** — separate organizations, roles, document-set permissions, and user sessions.
- **Bilingual interface** — Persian and English UI, light and dark themes, and responsive layouts.

## Architecture at a glance

Nexora uses a React/Vite frontend, a FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL for application data, and Qdrant for vector retrieval. The API, document worker, and connector scheduler are separate processes that share the same database, document storage, and Qdrant configuration.

```text
Browser → React UI → FastAPI API → PostgreSQL
                              ↘ → Qdrant
                              ↘ → OpenRouter-compatible LLM

Document worker → storage → extraction/OCR → chunking and indexing → Qdrant
Connector scheduler → permitted remote sources → document processing queue
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for component boundaries, data flow, worker behavior, and RAG retrieval details.

## Quick start with Docker

Docker Compose is the recommended way to run the full local stack. It starts PostgreSQL, Qdrant, the API, document worker, connector scheduler, and frontend together.

### Requirements

- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2
- At least 4 GB of free memory for a comfortable local stack

### Configure the environment

From the repository root:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.docker.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace the database password in both `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `DATABASE_URL`. Also set a random `AUTH_SECRET_KEY` of at least 32 characters. Keep the included development cookie settings for local HTTP only.

### Start the stack

```powershell
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The first start applies Alembic migrations before the API and workers begin.

To confirm that PostgreSQL, Qdrant, document storage, and both workers are ready:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:5173/api/ready | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
```

For logs from a single service:

```powershell
docker compose logs -f document-worker
```

The Compose setup limits the document worker to 0.75 CPU cores and 2 GB of memory by default. This limits local resource contention, but it can make indexing slower. Adjust those limits in `compose.yml` only after considering the capacity of the host.

## Run without Docker

Use this option when PostgreSQL and Qdrant are already available elsewhere.

### Backend

```powershell
cd backend
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Set, at minimum, the following values in `backend/.env`:

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DATABASE
AUTH_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-random-value-of-at-least-32-characters
APP_ENV=development
AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=false
FRONTEND_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173

QDRANT_URL=http://YOUR-QDRANT-HOST:6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=
QDRANT_COLLECTION=rag_chunks

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_MODEL=openrouter/free
```

Apply migrations and start the three backend processes in separate terminals:

```powershell
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
alembic upgrade head

# Terminal 1
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Terminal 2
python -m app.workers.document_worker

# Terminal 3
python -m app.workers.connector_scheduler_worker
```

### Frontend

```powershell
cd frontend/my-rag-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and proxies `/api` calls to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Document processing and OCR

PDF files with a text layer and TXT files are extracted locally. OCR is disabled by default, so scanned documents are not sent to an external provider until one is configured.

To enable MinerU for Persian scanned documents:

```dotenv
OCR_PROVIDER=mineru
MINERU_API_TOKEN=your-token
MINERU_LANGUAGE=fa
MINERU_MODEL_VERSION=vlm
```

Set `OCR_PROVIDER=auto` to try configured providers in this order: MinerU, Google Vision, and Azure Document Intelligence. Before enabling a cloud OCR provider, confirm that sending the original document to that provider is permitted by the organization’s data policy.

The application does not currently include malware scanning. Do not treat MIME checks and file-size limits as an antivirus control. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) describes the required quarantine-and-scan flow before production use with untrusted files.

## Operations

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | Lightweight API liveness check. |
| `GET /ready` | Readiness check for PostgreSQL, Qdrant, writable document storage, document worker, and connector scheduler. |

`/ready` returns `503` until all required dependencies and worker heartbeats are available. This is intentional and makes it suitable for deployment readiness probes.

For production, use HTTPS, set `APP_ENV=production`, set `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true`, restrict `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` to the real frontend origin, and keep PostgreSQL and Qdrant off the public network. Full deployment guidance is available in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Quality checks

The repository has separate backend and frontend checks:

```powershell
# Backend
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pytest

# Frontend unit tests and production build
cd frontend/my-rag-app
npm run test
npm run build

# Frontend end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

GitHub Actions runs backend tests on pushes and pull requests to `dev` and `main`. A separate frontend workflow runs unit tests, a production build, and Playwright end-to-end tests on GitHub-hosted runners, so those checks do not consume local CPU while working on the project.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | First checks |
| --- | --- |
| A document remains at 0% or 10% | Confirm `document-worker` is running, then inspect `/ready` and the document processing error. |
| A scanned document fails | Check `OCR_PROVIDER`, provider credentials, page limits, and OCR timeout settings. |
| The frontend reports `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8000` | Start the FastAPI API on port 8000 or correct the development proxy target. |
| `/ready` returns 503 | Check PostgreSQL, Qdrant, writable storage, document worker, and connector scheduler. |
| A connector does not synchronize | Check the scheduler, connector configuration, lease state, and the last synchronization error. |

## Security note

Do not commit `.env` files, passwords, API keys, OAuth refresh tokens, Qdrant keys, or OCR credentials. Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before exposing the application to users or connecting it to organization data.
